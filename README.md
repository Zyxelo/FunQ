# The App
FunQ (FunQueue) is a digital queueing web application where visitors can queue for events and releases of different sorts.

Two main functions will be developed

1. Visitor (queuer)
2. Event organizer

The visitor can browse different events or queueing campaigns, both from "featured events", search bar, or direct link.
The visitor enters the queue and a timer until the queue stops is visible. 
Every x min the visitor has to enter a captcha code to keep the queueing spot.
If the visitor doesn't do this, it will lose y spots until next captcha appears.
When queueing timer reaches zero, the visitor redirects to final page. 
Final page is where you confirm your purchase in some way. This may vary from swish, paypal or redirect to another page.

The event organizer can create events and choose settings depending on the event/campaign.
Example of settings can be: number of queue spots, date and time of queue, how often visitor has to enter captcha, etc.
Event organizer chooses final page of the queue, where the visitor can for example obtain temporary coupon code, or pay for ticket.
